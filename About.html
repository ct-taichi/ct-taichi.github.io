      <p>Tai chi, what's in it for me? Are you looking to reduce stress, in a practical and
      efficient way? Could your ability to concentrate, focus and recall details stand to be
      sharpened? Would you like to lower your blood pressure or better manage your blood sugar
      levels? Do you suffer from arthritis, fibromyalgia or chronic pain? Are you concerned
      about preventing falls through improved balance, leg strength and coordination? Would you
      like to find a way to calm down the running thoughts, get centered, rejuvenate your
      emotional outlook and sleep better at night? A recent article in the New York Times was
      headlined: &quot;A downside to Tai Chi? None that I see.&quot; There are several medical
      research studies confirming what practitioners have known for years.</p>
      <p>Tai Chi is a Chinese internal martial art based upon the philosophy of the
      complementary opposites of Yin and Yang. Qigong is one component of tai chi which General
      Chen Wangting (9th generation of Chen Family) created about 350 years ago by combining
      knowledge of qigong, doa yin (breath control), tui na (massage) and external fighting arts
      into the art form of taiji chuan (translated as Supreme Ultimate Fist). So when one
      practices tai chi one is automatically practicing qigong. The difference between qigong
      and tai chi is that tai chi has two additional layers of complexity added: choreography of
      a routine and the numerous self-defense applications of each form. While some teachers
      choose to ignore the martial aspect of tai chi, Kathy finds it effective to refer to
      application examples to help students spatially orient themselves within the structure of
      a posture. An example is it is easier for one to perform the yang form &quot;strum the
      lute&quot; accurately once it is demonstrated that one is trapping a person's arm above
      and below the elbow than for the teacher to correct arms that are not held in alignment,
      held too far apart, held too high or cross one another. Instead of correcting the various
      ways one could mistakenly hold the hands in relation to one another, it is far better to
      give students a memorable image that will anchor their position in space. Using
      appropriate martial application examples makes learning more concrete. For tai chi to be
      done properly it must follow sound structural, biomechanical and classical rules. It does
      not matter for which purpose one does tai chi - meditation, health, competition or
      self-defense - good tai chi form is evident by using good tai chi principles. As one of my
      teachers Grandmaster Chen Zhenglei www.cstjq.com (19th generation Chen family) once said:
      &quot;First we did taiji for self-defense, then we invented gun powder, so now we just do
      it for health.&quot; As with any art form practiced over time, there has been continual
      expansion, innovation and differentiation of styles and training techniques.
      Chronologically the Chen style is the root of tai chi and over time other family styles
      have emerged such as the more popular in the west Yang style, Wu style, Wu Hao style and
      the most recently created Sun style.</p>

      <p>As a teacher Kathy is very adept at captivating audiences while meeting the needs of
      individual participants. With graduate level coursework in Educational Psychology and a
      published thesis on applying Competency Based Education to an outdoor adventure program
      for youth, she utilizes a number of strategies to make each experience fun, relevant and
      productive. As individual learners we process information in an individually preferred
      combination of the visual, auditory and kinesthetic modes. In Kathy's programs you see the
      movements being precisely modeled, while hearing specific instructions, to enable you to
      experience the feeling of the forms. Printed materials are also utilized as appropriate to
      help facilitate the learning process. Read what others say in testimonials from students,
      host organizations and supervisors. </p>

      <p>&quot;Nature's Qigong&quot; is a program which Kathy developed in 2003 and was
      originally piloted with preschool Head Start students. Since that time the routine has
      rejuvenated all students who experience this joyful series of gentle forms from ages 3 to
      98. Using visualizations and movements of various animals and aspects of nature to focus
      one's mind, combined with natural breathing, this particular qigong routine is easy to
      remember. While Nature's Qigong is based on traditional eastern exercises learned from
      various teachers over a long period of time, it is very accessible as Kathy has renamed a
      number of the movements to correspond better with our familiar western culture.
      Participants can immediately participate with the qigong routine as there are is
      sufficient repetition of each form and the order in which one does the numerous forms is
      not important. Some of the benefits of qigong are stress reduction, increased
      concentration, reduction of high blood pressure and a better night's sleep.</p>

      <p>Kathy's philosophy is that while tai chi and qigong can sometimes be viewed as
      esoteric, both are practical systems which with proper instruction can be demystified.
      Correct body alignment and mechanics, coupled with relaxing muscular tension and opening
      of the joints, are keys to building the foundation for the natural flow of qi (internal
      energy). The value of having a qualified instructor be able to model and mold your
      physical structure is critical so that you can reap the internal benefits of these arts.
      One must have a clear understanding, a good teacher and diligent practice to go beyond the
      stage of mere physical exercise into the development of gongfu. In Chinese medicine it is
      believed that it is the blockage of qi which causes pain and disease. Qigong and tai chi
      feel good, as well as, are good for you. The gentle, flowing movements relax the body,
      focus the mind and calm the spirit. If the concept of qi puts you at odds with your
      rational mind, let that part go, focus on your physical structure. Having begun her own
      tai chi journey as a scientifically trained skeptic, Kathy frequently states that
      &quot;you don't need to believe in qi to let it work for you!&quot;</p>

      <p>The teachers which Kathy has been blessed to have studied with over the past 23 years
      are of very high quality. During the first ten years of her training she was primarily
      learning the Yang style forms of both mainland China and the 37 form of Taiwan immigrant
      Cheng Manching. These early teachers include: David Chandler, Master Jou Tsung Hwa, David
      Ritchie, Jian Jianye, William C.C. Chen and Dr. Yang Jwing Ming. Experiences with these
      teachers nurtured a passion to better understand the philosophy, history and fundamental
      principles of tai chi. In 1996 she began training with Baiqing Li's School of Tai Chi in
      western Massachusetts and there more fully developed an understanding of proper body
      structure, committed to a disciplined personal practice structure and forged life long
      friendships with training peers. Under Baiqing and Mei Han Li's extended family
      environment in addition to training, performing at cultural events and competing in
      martial art tournaments Kathy undertook two cultural exchange trips with the Li's to China
      and Tibet. </p>

      <p>&quot;When the student is ready, the teacher will appear&quot; is a traditional saying
      that came true for Kathy in the fall of 1998. While at an international martial arts
      tournament at which Grandmaster Chen Zhenglei was an honored judge, Baiqing Li persuaded
      him to come to New England to teach a couple seminars on Chen style taiji. Grandmaster
      Chen Zhenglei is one of the four tigers or taiji diamonds of taiji hailing from
      Chenjiagou, the birthplace village of taiji. The following June both Grandmaster Chen
      Zhenglei and his accompanying disciple Master Wang Hai Jun taught their first of many
      subsequent seminars in MA. . Up to this point Kathy was primarily practicing and teaching
      Yang style, competition, straight sword, broadsword and Dr Paul Lam's Sun style tai chi
      for arthritis forms. Given the marvelous opportunity of being introduced to these high
      level teachers, from 1999 forward Kathy began to devote the bulk of her personal practice
      to learning the Chen style system of taiji. Grandmaster Chen Zhenglei is recognized by
      China as one of five living cultural treasures, a ceremony he was unable to attend as at
      that the moment he was having dinner with us and host C.P. Ong in the Washington, D.C.
      area conducting a student seminar. In addition to training with Grandmaster Chen Zhenglei
      when he visits Boston, MA on an annual basis, Kathy credits the bulk of her hands on
      instruction and conceptual guidance to Master Wang Hai Jun with whom she trains
      intensively with during his three yearly visits ranging between 12 and 18 days per year.
      It is a privilege to study with such an outstanding human being with exceptional coaching
      qualifications. Master Wang Hai Jun was sent to live with his teacher Grandmaster Chen
      Zhenglei at the age of 11 years old and his ability to &quot;eat bitter&quot; (train hard)
      is well known. He was China's National Champion in 1996, 1997 and 1998 in all three
      categories of taiji form, push hands and taiji sword. Being a body art form taiji can be
      transmitted from teacher to student without sharing a common spoken language, but Kathy is
      very appreciative of the progressive mastery of the English language that Master Wang Hai
      Jun has acquired since relocating to Manchester, England. Kathy's goal is to learn the
      entire Chen Taiji training system as its riches have greatly deepened my understanding and
      execution of all tai chi forms and qigong. To date in the Chen system she is well versed
      in: qigong, 18 Essential form, Lao Jia Yi Lu (Old Frame First Routine), Lao Jia Er Lu (Old
      Frame Second Routine) aka Pao Chui (Cannon Fist), 56 Competition form, Jian (straight
      sword), Dao (broad sword), Guan Dao (Spring and Autumn Falchion) and the five stages of
      Push Hands. She is working on improving her Shuang Dao (double broad swords) form and when
      her teacher feels the time is right what remains to be learned in the Chen system is: long
      pole, Xin Jia Yi Lu (New Frame First Routine), Xing Jia Er Lu (New Frame Second Routine)
      and Spear known as the king of weapons. Another goal of Kathy's is to play tai chi in
      every town in her home state of Connecticut to spread awareness of its beauty and
      benefits. If you would like to host an introductory presentation, participatory qigong
      session and tai chi performance contact her at kabtaichi@yahoo.com . </p>

      <p>Traveling to China in 2000 with other students and family members of the School of Tai
      Chi was organized in collaboration with the Beijing Sports Institute as a cultural
      exchange program of west meets east tai chi enthusiasts. A welcome banquet was held where
      groups from both continents demonstrated various contemporary tai chi forms and a
      documentary filmed by China's CCTV in a secluded temple section of the Forbidden City. It
      is quite an experience to view yourself spewing rapid Mandarin during the aired interviews
      thanks to dubbing when your knowledge of the language was really confined to some basic
      polite phrases and the names of tai chi forms. The group also spent plenty of time in the
      parks, on the sidewalks in front of the apartment buildings and in the hutongs playing tai
      chi with the locals. Together we did 24 form simplified Yang style, 42 competition form of
      combined styles created in 1990 for the Asian Games, 48 old competition form of combined
      styles created in 1976, 32 combined style sword, 42 combined style competition sword,
      mulan fan, double mulan fans and the newly created tai chi kung fu fan designed to impress
      the Olympic Committee in Beijing's bid for the 2008 Olympics. In addition to the tai chi
      cultural exchange program small segments of the group undertook home visits with Beijing
      residents and toured cultural sites in the regions of Beijing, Xian, Guilin and Shanghai.
      In 2002 Kathy returned to China with the Li family further exploring the environs of
      Beijing, land marks of Sichuan Province (such as Emei Mountain, Leishan Buddha and the
      Three Gorges of the Li River), Tibet autonomous region between Lhasa and Xigaze, and Hong
      Kong. In less than two years the economic prosperity and cultural shift to expounding upon
      consumerism of the country was palpable. <br>
